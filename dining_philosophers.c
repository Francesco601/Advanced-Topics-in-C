/* In computer science, the Dining Philosopher's Problem
   is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithms
   to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for
   resolving them. In the problem, five philosophers dine
   together at the same table. Each philosopher has their own
   place at the table. There is a fork between each plate.
   The dish served is a kind of spaghetti which has to be
   eaten with two forks. Each philosopher can only alternately
   ext and think. Moreover, a philosopher can only eat
   her spaghetti when she has both a left and right fork. The
   problem is how to design a regimen (a concurrent algorithm)
   such that no philosopher will starve. The problem was designed
   to illustrate the challenges of avoiding deadlock, a state of
   a system in which no progress is possible. The following solution
   uses one mutex, one semaphore and one state variable per philosopher.
   It is bases on a solution devised by Dijkstra and modified by
   Tannenbaum.
