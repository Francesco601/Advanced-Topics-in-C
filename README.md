# Advanced-Topics-in-C
A repository for programs that illustrate advanced concepts in C programming, with a focus on operating  systems and systems programming


**To run any of these programs on Linux or Mac, check if you have installed the gcc compiler from GNU.**
```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc
``` 
or for Arch based distros:

```bash
sudo pacman -S gcc
```
this will install most depencies.

 After you verify gcc, type in terminal, for example:

``` 
gcc -o karatsuba karatsuba.c;  karatsuba 
```
or replace karatsuba.c with whatever the name of the file you wish to run or modify.

For Windows, you may have to use Clang or some other compiler to compile.
